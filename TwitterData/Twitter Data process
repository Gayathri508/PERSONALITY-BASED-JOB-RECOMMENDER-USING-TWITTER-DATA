Importing Twitter Data 
Steps to follow in order to get data from twitter
Create a Twitter account
Go to https://apps.twitter.com/ and log in with your Twitter credentials
Click "Create new app"
Fill out the form and create your Twitter application
Next click on "API keys" tab and copy "API key" and "API secret".
Next click "create access token" and copy your "Access token" and "Access token secret"
We use TWEEPY package in order to use the twitter API and get the posts of a particular person.
By using the consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token ,access_token_secret keys we authenticate the user and try to connect to twitter and import the  tweets of the user.
